  description: Its a pinda, did you know that if you make sauce out of pinda its
    actually called "pindasaus"and not sate, sate is one of the things that can be
    made USING pindasaus, sate is made with pindasaus and added spices, unlike what
    the media is trying to force into your brain, it is not just sauce made of pinda,
    for that would be called pindasaus, and not sate. thanks you
